# GOV.UK Content AI Agents

Welcome to the documentation for the Multi-Agent Content Review System.

## Overview

This system uses a team of specialized AI agents to review and improve content against GOV.UK standards.

### Agents (Stage 2)

- **Content Reviewer**: Checks structure, clarity, and user need focus.
- **Style Compliance**: Enforces GOV.UK specific style guide rules (passive voice, sentence length).
- **Consistency**: Uses Vector Search to ensure new content doesn't contradict or duplicate existing content.
- **Improvement**: Automatically rewrites content based on feedback from other agents.
- **Quality Judge**: The final decision maker that scores content (0-100) and approves/rejects it.
